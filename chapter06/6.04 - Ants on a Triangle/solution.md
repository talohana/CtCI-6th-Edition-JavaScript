- Each ant stand on a triangle vertex
- Each ant chooses a direction (out of two directions) with equal probability
- What is the probability of 2 ants or all ants to collide?
- Generalize the answer to _n ants_,

The ants will not collide if they all go _the same_ direction. The probability of this is: 2 \* (1/2)<sup>3</sub>  
There are 2 directions and each directions has 1/2 probability.

Therefore the probability of collision is 1 - 2 \* (1/2)<sup>3</sub>

To generalize to _n ants_ the probability would be 1 - 2 \* (1/2)<sup>n</sub>
