- 8x8 chessboard with two diagonal corners cut off
- Each domino takes two squares
- Can you place 31 dominos to cover the entire board?

8x8 chessboard contains 32 black tiles and 32 white tiles.  
After cutting off two diagonal edges (say, two black ones) we left with 30 black tiles and 32 white tiles.  
Since every domino covers two consecutive tiles, each domino covers a white tile and a black tile.

After placing 30 dominos we'll be left with 2 white tiles with no option to place the last domino.

Therefore it is _impossible to cover the chessboard with 31 dominos_
