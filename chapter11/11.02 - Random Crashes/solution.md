## Step 1: Understand the Scenario

From what we know from the question

- The application is single threaded and only uses C standard library
- It never crashes in the same place (after 10 debugging sessions)

We need to find _programming errors_ which could cause the crash, and explain how to test each one.

We need to understand some things regarding the program and the environment

1. What are the program arguments
2. What is the expected output
3. What operating system does the user have
4. What date/time zone the user is at
5. Hardware spec such as RAM, Memory, CPU etc

## Step 2: Break Down the Problem

The problem can either by from within the program or an external error. Lets break this into two categories

1. Internal Errors  
   C Standard library holds Date, Time and mathematical objects and function. Some of them are _non-deterministic_.

   For example, `Math.random()` or `Date.now()` will yield different result each time.

   Another possibility might be writing / reading from the file system, when other process is deleting / locking the file.

2. External Errors  
   Perhaps the user is running out of memory (in the entire operating system), which happens by spikes and causes the program to crash at random places.
