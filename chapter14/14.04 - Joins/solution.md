`JOIN` is used to combine the results of two tables.

`INNER JOIN` would contain only the data where the criteria match.

`LEFT JOIN` will contain all records from the left table. If no matching records were found from the right table the missing fields from the left table will be NULL values.

`RIGHT JOIN` is essentially the same as `LEFT JOIN` but the tables are opposite.

`FULL OUTER JOIN` combine the results of the `LEFT JOIN` and the `RIGHT JOIN`.
